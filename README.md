# Social-Network-Customer-Acquisition-Predictor-Using-Classification-Algorithms
<h2>Objective :</h2>
This project aimed at predicting the likelihood of an individual joining a social network based on their age and salary.The project explores various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classification (SVC), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes algorithm and Decision tree classification model to evaluate their performance in this predictive task.
